He was a farmer by profession. In his 60s When he was not able to continue with farming.  He started working as shop keeper, a small cabin on the main street of the village, and on/off worked as a daily wager with local farmers. After 10 years  When I (his only son) was 14, I started to insist in front of him to not work and let me take responsibility of the home.  I was not able to see him working in such hard conditions with a full white beard. He then told me \"Look son, I am working in my 70s so that you do not have an excuse to quit education.\" These words of him still echos in my ear and I am not able to rest a full night. Whenever I waste an hour it reminds me of his efforts and works for my success. He worked when others were planning retirement. He worked in June & July, under the skin burning sun, cold nights, and rains. He wanted to see his son, the first family member, to be graduated. It was 3 years before in 2018 when I graduated from FAST NUCES. He was so happy to see me wearing a cap and gown. And I was happy to see him smiling. It was the first time in a decade when we were so much happy as the whole world had been conquered.
